REST API Backend for InventoryManager app. Includes a web server created with Flask and a MYSQL Database created with SQLAlchemy. 

The database is currently hosted locally, and can be created with the docker-compose.yml file in order to save data. The plan for a future version is to host the database on AWS in order to remove this extra step.
