# EZventory Backend

REST API Backend for [EZventory app](https://github.com/DinuWije/EZventory), includes a web server created with Flask and a MYSQL Database managed with SQLAlchemy. Authentication of users is handled with tokens and communication with the frontend is done via HTTP requests (initally tested on Postman).

The database and web server were containerized with Docker before and are currently hosted on an AWS EC2 instance.
